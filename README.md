# Delmove
With Delmove user can remove all moving objects from the picture. Let's imagine a common situation where you are taking a photo of an architectural monument and some people or cars enter the frame. Our app is created for solving exact problems. So with its help, you can get photos, which are clean from moving objects such as people or cars.

It uses median filtration. We sort the brightness of all pixels for different frames and take the central element of the sorted array. In the previous part, we worked with a pixel array in one frame, but here we work with appropriate pixels in a set of frames.
